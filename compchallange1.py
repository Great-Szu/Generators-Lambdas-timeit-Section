# Create a new Python file - I've called this one "compchallenge1.py".
#
# use the conditional expression from the previous video to produce
# a list comprehension that returns the fizzbuzz results.

# If a number's divisible by 3, the value should be "fizz".
# if it's divisible by 5, the value should be "buzz".
# If it's divisible by 3 and 5, the value should be "fizz buzz"
# Finally, if none of those conditions apply, the value will be the number itself.

# The code from the end of the last video appears below, so you can check the result.
