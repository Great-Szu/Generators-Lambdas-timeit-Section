# In the section on Functions, we looked at 2 different ways to calculate the factorial
# of a number. We used an iterative approach, and also used a recursive function.

# This challenge is to use the timeit module to see which performs better.

# The two function appear below.

# Hint: change the number of iterations to 1,000 or 10,000. The default
# of one million will take a long time to run.
